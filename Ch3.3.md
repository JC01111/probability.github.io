## 3.3 Standard Deviation and Normal Approximation

#### We use X - μ to find the deviation for a random variable X, but we know the mean E(x) = μ, so we may get X- μ = 0. To avoid this, we need to find the absolute value of X - μ to get the deviation. So, it is a good idea that we square X - μ to find it's deviation.


$Var(X) = E[(X - μ)^2]$ <br>
By this formula, we can get the computational formula for variance, <br>
$E[(X - μ)^2] = E[X^2-2μX + μ^2]$ <br> $= E[]$
